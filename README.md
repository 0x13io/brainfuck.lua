brainfuck.lua
=============

A simple brainfuck parser written in lua!

#How-to
1. Clone the git onto your computer / server
2. make sure you've got lua installed (if not... install it)
3. put your code into a file alongside brainfuck.lua
4. run "lua brainfuck.lua <name of code file here>"

#Have fun!
I've just made this as a small project. If you want to use it in any project feel free to take it and do with it what you like!
